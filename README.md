# Qiskit-demo
Demo code for the short quantum computing course to be run on 10 August 2025. [TODO update this with more details later]

## Quick Setupâš¡

> [!Important]
> Make sure you have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

Before we start working with Qiskit we need to install some libraries.

Open your terminal and run the following command to install all the libraries you'll need for this demo:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Launch the Notebook
Now you can open the demo notbook in jupyter lab using the command:
```bash
jupyter notebook qc-workshop.ipynb
```
> [!NOTE]
> You can also run the notebook in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if you prefer by installing the [Jupyter extation]( https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)
